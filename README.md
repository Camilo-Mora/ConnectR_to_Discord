# How to Connect R to Discord
To be able to delete messages from Discord, R needs specific credentials. Here I describe oe working apprach toa chive this. Caution: sending numerous requests to Discord causes it to blck the Bot.

1. Login into your account and create a channel

4. Create webhook. Needed for TV to send messages and for R to send delete messages.
Click on Edit Channel.

</p>

5. Add a new Bot. This is basically the connectivity used by R to reach discord. from here we need a TOKEN, and install the bot in the channel.
   With the discord open, open this URL: https://discord.com/developers/applications

then click on existing or new one.

</p>

Click on BOT, then define the settings, like administrator. Then click on reset token, then copy it.

</p>

6. Load the Bot in the channel. Got to OAUTHo2 and then to URL generator.. tick on Bot, and admisnistrator..at the bottom should appear a URL, copy and paste it in your browser, hit Enter
<p align="center">

</p>

Select the channel to which you want to add the BOT. Click Continue and then Autorize.

</p>

You are set. With the approach above you obtained Channel ID, Webhook for channel, and Token.

NOTE: in R, the Token need to be preceeded with the word "Bot TOKEN" like "Bot MTA3NjM2M...."
